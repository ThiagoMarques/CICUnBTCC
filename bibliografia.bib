  abstract={ABED is free and open-source software for simulating evolutionary game dynamics in finite populations. We explain how ABED can be used to simulate a wide range of dynamics considered in the literature and many novel dynamics. In doing so, we introduce a general model of revisions for dynamic evolutionary models, one that decomposes strategy updates into selection of candidate strategies, payoff determination, and choice among candidates. Using examples, we explore ways in which simulations can complement theory in increasing our understanding of strategic interactions in finite populations.},

	abstract = {AI agents are being developed to help people with high stakes decision-making processes from driving cars to prescribing drugs. It is therefore becoming increasingly important to develop "explainable AI" methods that help people understand the behavior of such agents. Summaries of agent policies can help human users anticipate agent behavior and facilitate more effective collaboration. Prior work has framed agent summarization as a machine teaching problem where examples of agent behavior are chosen to maximize reconstruction quality under the assumption that people do inverse reinforcement learning to infer an agent's policy from demonstrations. We compare summaries generated under this assumption to summaries generated under the assumption that people use imitation learning. We show through simulations that in some domains, there exist summaries that produce high-quality reconstructions under different models, but in other domains, only matching the summary extraction model to the reconstruction model produces high-quality reconstructions. These results highlight the importance of assuming correct computational models for how humans extrapolate from a summary, suggesting human-in-the-loop approaches to summary extraction.},

They are relevant for educational purposes, for the acquisition of technical and nontechnical skills, of automatic reflexes, and of ways of thinking. The suitability of the teaching strategy in link with the profile of participants and the moderation by the trainers are difficult. The present work aims at solving these difficulties by the development of a distributed multitier architecture, computer-assisted training, a multiagent system, and requirements for a relevant physical infrastructure. Our methodology integrates four steps: exercise modeling, scenario modeling, scenario simulation with a multiagent system, debriefing approach and learning objectives assessment. Our methodological recommendations have been applied in order to define a real semi-virtual training environment. Limits and prospects are already identified for further improvements.},

We hypothesize that people with autism suffer from difficulties in learning social rules from examples. Many remediation strategies have not taken this into account. Therefore an appropriate remediation strategy is to teach not simply via examples but to teach the rule along with it. In this study we suggest a reasoning rehabilitation strategy, based on playing with a computer based mental simulator that is capable of modeling mental and emotional states of the real world. A model of the mental world is presented in 12 steps. We describe our implementation of a natural language multiagent system that simulates this model. In addition we describe the system's user interface for autistic rehabilitation. This system is subject to short-term and long-term evaluation of rehabilitation of autistic reasoning. Case studies with children who used it extensively are presented. Implications specifically in terms of autistic rehabilitation as well as generally in terms of reasoning about mental states are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Student models are more complex than other user models because the student is likely to have misconceptions. We have addressed several difficult issues in reasoning about a student's knowledge and skills within a real-time simulation-based training system. Our conceptual framework enables important aspects of the tutor's reasoning to be based upon simple, comprehensible representations that are the basis for a Student Centered Curriculum. We have built a system for teaching cardiac resuscitation techniques in which the decisions about how to teach are separated from the decisions about what to teach. The training context (i.e., choice of topics) is changed based on a tight interaction between student modeling techniques and simulation management. Although complex student models are still required to support detailed reasoning about how to teach, we argue that the decision about what to teach can be adequately supported by qualitatively simpler techniques, such as overlay models. This system was evaluated in formative studies involving medical school faculty and students. Construction of the student model involves monitoring student actions during a simulation and evaluating these actions in comparison with an expert model encoded as a multi-agent plan. The plan recognition techniques used in this system are novel and allow the expert knowledge to be expressed in a form that is natural for domain experts.},

	abstract = {Biological phenomena can be investigated at multiple levels, from the molecular to the cellular to the organismic to the ecological. In typical biology instruction, these levels have been segregated. Yet, it is by examining the connections between such levels that many phenomena in biology, and complex systems in general, are best explained. We describe a computation-based approach that enables students to investigate the connections between different biological levels. Using agent-based, embodied modeling tools, students model the microrules underlying a biological phenomenon and observe the resultant aggregate dynamics. We describe 2 cases in which this approach was used. In both cases, students framed hypotheses, constructed multiagent models that incorporate these hypotheses, and tested these by running their models and observing the outcomes. Contrasting these cases against traditionally used, classical equation-based approaches, we argue that the embodied modeling approach connects more directly to students' experience, enables extended investigations as well as deeper understanding, and enables "advanced" topics to be productively introduced into the high school curriculum.

Through the application of an on-line participatory process to build a future vision of Bad (Apulia Region), this study explores elements related to the behavior of the knowledge agents involved in the process and compares them with the application of previous face-to-face classroom examples. The results obtained allow to collect some suggestions not only on the performance of the application in two different times, but also on the potential elements of difference to be associated to the temporal and psychological context related to the diffusion of Covid-19. Since these conditions are clearly exceptional and practically (hopefully) unrepeatable, the results seem to show a mixed perspective of effectiveness for the use of online education to build a future vision of a city.},
